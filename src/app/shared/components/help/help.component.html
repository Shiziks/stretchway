                    Absolutely! Warming up is essential. You must warm up if you want to see the progress and be safe. Our mucles are made to do strength moves and stretching moves and we should
                    use the full capabilities of our muscles and not only focus on one or the other. Plus strong muscle is a muscle that will stretch more easily.
                    <!-- Proper warming up is essential to safely do any kind of stretching plus for acheiving results. You can choose any kind of warmup you want. But make sure that
                    you do it for at least 10 minutes and that you started to sweat. If you are a person who does not get sweaty quickly, or ever, than make sure that your heart rate
                    did get elevated and stayed elevated for 10 minutes (anywhere between 95 to 120 heartbeats per minute). -->

                    <!-- If you really do not know what to do to warm up than you can use your favorite song put it on hight volume and just dance like no one is watching for 10 minutes. -->
                    Do at least 10 minutes of warmup before starting to stretch. You can do a cardio warmup (put your favorite song on and dance like no one is watching), or do strength work and than start
                    to stretch. I personly recomend that you do strength exercises before stretching. So if you are about to stretch your legs, than do some squats, lunges, balances... any exercises that do target your leg muscles.
                    You'll know you are warmed up enough when you start to sweat, or if you are a person who does not sweat than as soon as you start to feel the burn in your muscles.

                    Absolutely. For some 30 seconds will be too much, and that is ok, you'll build up to that 30 seconds. And for some 30 will seem too litle, and you can hold it a
                     bit longer, but you will see results even if you hold it for just 30s.

                    It depends on few factors. First is how flexible you are to begin with. Second your genetics. Third the way you live your life. Fourth your dedication to really do the stretches regularly. Some of you may see it in a month and for some it will take longer.
                    I am doing this for 6 months now and I am still seeing progress.
